# HTML: structure
## A. Elements
 - An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. 
Tags are referred to as elements.
 - All HTML elements can have attributes. Attributes provide additional information
 about elements.
 - Atributes require a name and a value.
## B. The different HTMLs
 - HTML 4 was released in 1997. Most elements are used today except <center>, 
  <font>, & <strike>. These can be
     accessed with CSS instead.
 - XHTML 1.0 was released in 2000. The key benefit was it works well with other
 programs written to create
     and process XML documents.
 -	HTML5 - Web pages do not need to close all tags and new elements & attributes
 were  introduced.
## C.  Attributes
 - ID attribute used to uniquely identify an element from other elements. The value
 should start with a letter or an underscore. No two elements on the same page will
 have the same value.
 - CLASS attribute - used to identify several elements as being different from other elements
## D.  Grouping text & elements in a block & inline
 -  Div - is a special element that lets you group similar sets of content together on a
 web page. By default, browsers always place a line break before and after
 the <div> element.   
 - The HTML <span> tag is used for grouping and applying styles to HTML: structure
## E. Elements

## H.  Grouping text & elements in a block & inline
 - Div - is a special element that lets you group similar sets of content together on a

  inline elements.
## I. Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <,>,and &.
      Example: &lt for left bracket or &amp for ampersand.

# The ABC of programming
### A. What is a script?
  1.  A script is made of instructions a computer follows step by step.
  2. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done 
with only HTML and CSS.
  3.Many browsers use JavaScript as a scripting language for doing dynamic things on the web. Any time you see a click-to-show 
dropdown menu, and  changing element colors on a page, 
these are the effects of JavaScript.
### B. Steps to writing javascript.
  1. Define the goal - decide what is needed by breaking it down into series of tasks and see what you want
 it to achieve.
  2. Create a flowchart - write down decisions that may cause the code to go in
 different directions to get to  the result.

### C. Objects & Properties
  1. objects are used to store keyed collections of various data. An object can 
   be created with figure brackets {â€¦} with an optional list of properties.
  2.  Each property has a name and a value and each name or value pairs tell
   you something about them.
### D.  Events
  1.  An event triggers something to happen. When a specific event happens, 
  that event can be used to trigger  a specific section of the code.
          onchange        An HTML element has been changed
          onclick                  The user clicks an HTML element
        onmouseover        The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
        onmouseout          The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
        onkeydown        The user pushes a keyboard key
        onload                  The browser has finished loading the page
### E.  Methods
  1.  JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. They can 
retrieve or update the values of an object's properties.
 Example - objectname.methodname - name = person.fullName();
### F.  How HTML, CSS, & Javascript fit together
  1. HTML allows you to focus on the content of the website. This gives the
 page structure and semantics.
  2. CSS enhances the HTML page with background, borders, colors & fonts.
  3. Javascript is added for the experience of interacting with the site. This controls
 on how the pages will behave.
