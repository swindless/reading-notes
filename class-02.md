## HTML- Creating Text
A. *Headings* - HTML offers six levels of heading tags, h1 through h6. The lower
the heading level number, the greater importance it becomes.The h1
headings are displayed in largest font, the h6 headings are smaller fonts.
B. *Creating Paragraphs* - Paragraph element is used to publish text on 
the web pages. Paragraph tags are very basic and is one of the first
tags coded for a webpage.
C. *Creating Line Breaks* - The br tag is used to insert a line break on the web page. Since the br is an empty element, no need of corresponding br tag.
D. *Creating White space*- Insert &nbsp; for creating extra consecutive spaces, while insert br tag for creating line breaks on your web pages.
### CSS - Cascading style sheet
A. With CSS, you can manage everything from font to layout to animations on your web page. 
You can apply styles directly to Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) to lay out a webpage, adjust font and color, create complex animations.
B. *External CSS* - External style sheets are separate files with a .css extension that          are referenced in the main HTML document. This file is in the link tag inside the head
in the HTML.  
C. **Inline style: CSS styles are written inside the style tag of an element.** 
D. *Internal style sheet*; CSS styles are written with the HTML in the same file under the head tag using the style element.
E. **CSS Selectors** -CSS selectors are used to  select the HTML elements you want to style.
- The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.
- The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute. To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.
- The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

# Basic Javascript
## Data types
1. A value in JavaScript is always of a certain type. For example, a string or a number.
2. The **number type** represents both integer and floating point numbers.
  Example: let n = 123; n = 12.345;.
3. A **string type** in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes. Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s no difference between them in JavaScript. 
4. The **boolean type** has only two values: true and false. This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.
## Variables
1. Variables are named values and can store any type of JavaScript value.
2. Here’s how to declare a variable: Example: var x = 100;
3. Naming variables
  - Variable names are pretty flexible as long as you follow a few rules:
  - Start them with a letter, underscore _, or dollar sign $.
  - After the first letter, you can use numbers, as well as letters, underscores,  or dollar signs.
  - Don’t use any of JavaScript’s reserved keywords.
### JavaScript switch
The **switch** is a conditional statement like if statement. Switch is useful when you want to execute one of the multiple code blocks based on the return value of a specified expression.
