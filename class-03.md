# HTML- Creating Links
1. The HTML ol tag is used for **ordered list.** We can use ordered list to represent items either in numerical order format or alphabetical order format, or any format where an order is emphasized.
- Numeric Number (1, 2, 3)
- Capital Roman Number (I II III)
- Capital Alphabet (A B C)
# HTML- Creating Boxes & Borders
1. **HTML Unordered List** or Bulleted List displays elements in bulleted format . We can use unordered list where we do not need to display items in any particular order. 
2. The **CSS border** properties allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border.
3. The **CSS margin** properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
4. The **CSS padding properties** are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.
#### JS Arrays
1. An array is an ordered list of values. Each value is called an element specified by an index. It stores elements with the types number, string, and boolean.
2. If you know the number of elements that the array will hold, you can create an array with an initial size as shown in the following example:
let colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
3. To access an element in an array, you specify an index in the square brackets []:  colors [].
