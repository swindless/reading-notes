<h1> Loop with Javascript</h1>
   

<p> Loops are a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. They repeat an action some number of times.
    A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.</p>
    
    The following occurs when a for loop executes:
<ol> 
    <li>The expression is initializing one or more loop counters which can declare variables. </li>
    <li>The condition expression is evaluated if the value is true, the loop will execute and continue. If the value is false, the for loop terminates.</li> 
    <li>The statement executes by using the block statement {} to group them. </li>
    <li>The expression is updated by an increment or decrement.</ll>
</ol>   
<p>JavaScript while statement creates a loop that executes a block of code as long as the test condition evaluates to true.</p>
<p>If the expression evaluates to true, the while statement executes the statement. If the expression evaluates to false, execution continues with the statement after the while loop.</p>
<p>The while loop evaluates the expression before each iteration, therefore, the while loop is known as a pretest loop.</p>
<p>The do-while loop statement creates a loop that executes a block of code until a test condition evaluates to false. The do-while loop always executes the body at least once before it evaluates the expression.</p>
<p>The most typical example of using the do-while loop is getting input from the user until the value provided is expected.</p>
