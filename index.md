# Growth mindset in Problem Solving

1. Collect data: Get all of the information needed to find a resolution to a problem.

2. Write it down: Make good notes on what you need to know or remember instead of trying to keep up with it mentally.  

3. Acceptance: Learn from any mistakes or any failures will create great success. Be prepared to accept some criticism from others to build up self-confidence and abilities.

4. Effort: Make an effort to learn from criticism and turn it into a positive outcome. Do not give up on the first sign of negativity, the more it’s worked on, the better it will become.

5. Get feedback: It’s good to ask for feedback or ask questions when needed from other team members. Sometimes another person can give a different point of view that will offer a great collaboration environment.
