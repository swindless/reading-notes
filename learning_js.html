<h1>How the computer works – The Input and Output</h1>  

<body>
      
   <p>The computer is considered a thinking machine that performs multiple tasks:</p> 
    <ul>
        <li> Input – what the user tells the computer what to do.</li>
        <li> Storage - handle the information stored in memory.</li>
        <li> Process – a series of commands that accepts the input in the computer and then sends it back to the computer for output – this is called algorithm.</li>
        <li> Output - can display text, photos, videos, or interactive games. When it comes to the internet, output can pass through and become someone’s input and vise versa. </li>
    </ul> 

<h3>Learning JavaScript</h3> 
    
    <p><em>JavaScript</em> is known for a scripting and interpreted language. It involves compilation during execution of a program at run time rather than before execution, which is known as (<b>just in time</b> (JIT). It is a compiled program language with first class functions.</p>
    <p>A <strong>function</strong> can pass an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function, and can be assigned as a value to a variable. It is a block of code designed to perform a particular task or when an event occurs – like when a user clicks on a button.</p>
    <p>The script element is used to embed executable code or data. It can be placed in the body or head section of the HTML webpage or in both. </p>
    <p>The external JavaScript is a file with a filename extension .js that is also created in the same HTML file.</p>
    
    <h4>The external JavaScript can be referenced in 3 ways:</h4>
    <ul class="tasks">
        <li> With the URL</li>
        <li>With the file path (/js/)</li>
        <li>Without the path</li>
    </ul>

  <p>The <strong>confirm() method</strong> is used to display a dialog with an optional message and two buttons, OK and Cancel. It returns true if the user clicks “OK”, and false otherwise. It prevents the user from accessing other parts of the page until the box is closed.</p>
