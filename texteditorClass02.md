# Choosing a Text Editor 

Text Editor allows you to write and manage text that is built for a web site.

**Important Features**

*Code completion* – displays possible suggestions of text while you are typing.  Emmet is shorthand language that speeds up the coding process. It shows closing tags and brackets when you use open tags and brackets.
*System highlighting* –takes the text you type and colorize the text. It makes it easier to locate errors.

*Variety of themes* – background color, series of text color. Users mostly prefer dark background and bright color text. (this makes it easier on the eyes for viewing).

*Selection of extensions* – add more features to your text editor. This will boost up your coding as much as needed.

### Types of text editors

Mac computers use “Text edit’, Windows use ‘Notepad’ and Linux use ‘Gedit’. These come with the computer system.

There are some more *advanced* free download text editors that can be installed.
+ Notepad ++ (windows only) is faster and handles large files compared to Notepad.
+ Atom is brought by Github and Brackets are brought by Adobe and offer live preview (windows & Mac).

An IDE **(Integrated Development Environment)** is a suite of all the different software
together. (text editor, a file manager, compiler and debugger). This makes it easier to recognize and minimize coding mistakes and typos.
