# Choosing a Text Editor 

Text Editor allows you to write and manage text that is built for a web site.

**Important Features**

*Code completion* – displays possible suggestions of text while you are typing.  Emmet is a shorthand language that speeds up the coding process. It shows closing tags and brackets when you use open tags and brackets.
*System highlighting* –takes the text you type and colorize the text. It makes it easier to locate errors.

*Variety of themes* – background color, series of text color. Users mostly prefer dark background and bright color text. (this makes it easier on the eyes for viewing).

*Selection of extensions* – add more features to your text editor. This will boost up your coding as much as needed.

### Types of text editors

Mac computers use “Text edit’, Windows use ‘Notepad’ and Linux use ‘Gedit’. These come with the computer system.

There are some more *advanced* free download text editors that can be installed.
+ Notepad ++ (used in windows only) is faster and handles large files compared to Notepad.
+ Atom is brought by Github. It offers flexible auto completion and built-in package manager. (used in windows, mac, and Linux)
+ Brackets are brought by Adobe and offer live preview (windows & Mac). It has been discontinued as of 2020. 

An IDE **(Integrated Development Environment)** is a suite of all the different software put
together. (text editor, a file manager, compiler and debugger). This makes it easier to recognize and minimize coding mistakes and typos.

# Learning about Linux 

Linux has a graphical user interface (GUI) that works as a terminal that runs Bash. 

The Shell (Bash)

*Bash* defines how the terminal will behave and look after executing commands.

A command line – text entered on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you after you click the enter key.

**ls** – a command entered after a prompt to display the list of computer files.

**-l** – provides a lot more information than the standard command. This shows the file permissions, the number of links, owner name, owner group, file size, time of last modification, and the file or directory name.

**Echo** – used to display a message or output of the results of other commands.

**Pwd** - *print working directory* - tells you what your current or present working directory is. 

A *path* means to get to a particular file or directory on the system. 

At the top of the structure is called the root directory. It’s denoted by a single slash (/). It has subdirectories and then more subdirectories and so on.

**Absolute paths** specify a file or directory in relation to the root directory. 

**Relative paths** specify a file or directory in relation to where we currently are in the system. (they will not begin with a slash).

~ tilde – shortcut for home directory. Example: /home/ryan/Documents or ~/Documents

.dot – this reference to the current directory. Example: ./Documents

..dot dot – this reference to the parent directory. Example: ../.. 

Command CD – changes the directory or location. (CD [location] without any argument then it will always take you back to the root directory.


File extension – are a set of 2 – 4 characters after a file stop at the end of a file.

Common file extensions are:
+ file.exe – executable file or program
+ file.txt – a plain text file
+ file.png – an image

Linux is case sensitive. It is possible to have two or more files and directories with the same name but letters of different case. Example: FILE.txt, File.txt, file.txt

To use spaces in names 
Use quotes around the entire name to be considered a single item. Example: ‘holiday photos’.

Use Escape characters by \ backsplash to escape the meaning of the next character. 

Hidden Files are used to prevent accidental changes. The ( . ) is placed at the beginning of the filename.  Example: .filename.txt

To list all files including the hidden files use ls –a command.
